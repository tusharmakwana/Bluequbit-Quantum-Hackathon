# Bluequbit-Quantum-Hackathon
Welcome to the BlueQubit Quantum Hackathon! Use your quantum computing skills to crack our peak circuits and earn points along the way. The challenge is ongoing, and the difficulty of the circuits will increase as you progress. The aim is to find the peak bitstring that has the maximum amplitude, standing out from the rest of the exponentially small amplitudes!

Challenge Details
Time Left: 13:55:40 (and counting...)
How to Participate
Download the QASM files for each problem. The circuits will progressively increase in difficulty.
Find the peak bitstring: This is the bitstring with the maximum amplitude, which stands out the most from the exponentially small amplitudes.
Submit your answer: Use the Submission tab to submit the peak bitstring. Both the peak bitstring and its reverse will be accepted as correct, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about bit ordering.
